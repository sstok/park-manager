            If this value is "0" the maximum amount of mailboxes <em>and</em> forwards is controlled by the actual fields.<br>
            If this value is <em>higher</em> than 0, the maximum number of mailboxes and forwards is counted as a whole, constrainted by this value.<br>
            If this value is -1, there is no limit on the amount of mailboxes and forwards.<br>

            Note that changing any of the constraints (provided by the Plan) will remove the Plan assignment.
            You can either use a Webhosting Plan <i>or</i> provide custom constraints.

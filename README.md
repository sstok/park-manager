Park-Manager
============

Park-Manager is a full-stack **hosting-management system**.

Park-Manager is provided as [Free Software][1] and can be completely customized
and extended to your needs.

 ##### :warning: Park-Manager is still actively developed. The current status is pre-alpha and not ready for production usage.
 ##### Major code changes should be expected.

Architecture
------------

The Park-Manager architecture consists of:

* The **Park-Manager framework** that supplies a set of reusable **PHP components**.
* The **Park-Manager platform** that provides the basics for any **hosting system**.
* The Park-Manager modules that provide the actual functionality, including:
  * Webhosting
  * DNS management
  * Support tickets

**Module system:**

> The Park-Manager module system was highly inspired on the [Symfony's bundle architecture][2]. 
> In fact, **a module is a bundle**, with some added functionality.

Installation
------------

* Install the Park-Manager system with [Docker][3] (*currently not ready*).
* Install the Park-Manager framework libraries (for your own projects) with [Composer][4].
* Park-Manager follows the [semantic versioning][5] strictly, 
  and has a release process that is predictable and business-friendly.
